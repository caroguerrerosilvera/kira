# About Kira

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Goal

Learn how React works internally when rendering components.

```
<div>
	<h1>Soy un t√≠tulo</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>Item 1</li>
		<li>Item 2</li>
		<li>Item 3</li>
	</ul>
<div>
```
